CS Course Work
==================================

Some (or all depending on how I felt the day of creating the clone) of 
the course work I've worked on pursuing my degree in Computer Science.
This is not comprehensive and is generally reflective of more recent studies.

# Folder Structure

The folders in this repository are organized so that you can use CMake
to build for your favorite platform and IDE. 

The three top-level folders:
- `apps`: Applications go here.  A sample application named `listtest`
  is located in this folder and can be used as a template for
  assignments.
- `include`:  Header files will go here.  The `CMake` sample
  applications in the `apps` folder are setup to get the header files
  from this folder.
- `docs`: Here's where documentation such as this file will live.
  Certain assignments will ask you to collect and report data on the
  programs you've written.  Document that information in this folder.
